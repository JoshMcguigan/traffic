# Traffic

Traffic is the easiest way to keep track of the traffic to your projects on Github. Traffic queries the Github API to build a traffic report for all of your projects.

## Setup

Traffic can be installed using cargo (`cargo install`). The first time running Traffic, you will be asked to enter your Github credentials. If you have two factor authentication enabled on Github you'll need to setup a personal access token for Traffic, with the read:user and repo permissions.
